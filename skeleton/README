ABOUT:
        The bus1-skeleton project contains the autotools skeleton used for all
        of the other bus1 projects written in C. The skeleton provides:
          - README and license related files
          - editor configuration
          - autotools skeleton
          - example binary org.bus1.skeleton
          - supports CC=clang and CC=gcc

        Whenever you copy the skeleton into a new project, search for
        'skeleton'/'SKELETON' and replace them by your project name.

        The skeleton configures autotools to put all caches, generated files,
        and other state tracking into the ./build/ subdirectory. In case of
        VPATH builds, the only generated files left in the $srcdir are:
          - ./aclocal.m4
          - ./configure
          - ./Makefile.in
        Apparently, those cannot be moved into subdirectories.

        You can build projects based on this skeleton via:
          $ ./autogen.sh c              # 'c' runs ./configure when done
          $ make                        # build project

        If you want VPATH builds, use something along the lines of:
          $ mkdir ./build/
          $ cd ./build/
          $ ../autogen.sh c
          $ make
